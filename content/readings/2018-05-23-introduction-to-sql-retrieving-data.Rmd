**This post is heavily based on [Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes (Fourth Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Minutes-Sams-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672336073). Please consider to buy the book if you find this post useful.** 

# The `SELECT` Statement

Each SQL statement is made up of one or more keywords.  

{{% alert note %}}
**Keyword**  

A reserved word that is part of the SQL language. Never name a table or column using a keyword.
{{% /alert %}}

To use `SELECT` to retrieve table data you must, at a minimum, specify two arguments - what you want to select, and from where you want to select it.  

# Retrieving Individual Columns

{{% alert warning %}}
The following is using the data provided by the author of the book in the [book Webpage.](http://forta.com/books/0672336073/) I am keeping a copy at my github page, named as [tysql](https://github.com/TheanLim/acadblog2/tree/master/public/data) but I do not own it. I am also using Microsoft Access throughout. Download the data, open it with Access, and find a  way to get to **SQL View** before executing SQL statements. There may be some differences brought by different versions of Microsoft Access.
{{% /alert %}}

You can type the following statements in the **SQL View** and **Run** it. 

```
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;
```
The above retrieves a single column called *prod_name* from the *Products* table in the dataset. The following is how it appears in the Microsoft Access.

**Terminating Statements**  

Multiple SQL statements must be separated by semicolons (the ; character).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert note %}}
CASE
{{% /alert %}}
The SQL statements are case-insensitive, so `SELECT` is the same as `select`, which is the same as `Select`. The convention is to use UPPERCASE for the KEYWORDS and lowercase for column and table names. While the SQL language is case-insensitive, the names of tables, columns, and values may not be.  

{{% alert note %}}
White space
{{% /alert %}}

In addition, all extra white space within a SQL statement is ignored when that statement is processed. So, the followings are the same:

```
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;  

SELECT prod_name FROM Products;  

SELECT
prod_name
FROM
Products;
```
# Retrieving Multiple Columns

When selecting multiple columns be sure to specify a comma between each column name, but not after the last column name.  

```
SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products;
```

# Retrieving All Columns

Use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in lieu of actual column names to retrieve all columns.  

```
SELECT *
FROM Products;
```
{{% alert note %}}
**Using Wildcards**  
As a rule, you are better off not using the * wildcard unless you really do need every column in the table. Retrieving unnecessary columns usually slows down the performance of your retrieval.  
{{% /alert %}}

# Retrieving Distinct Rows

Suppose you want the `DISTINCT` vendor ID of all vendors with products in the **products** table. Doing the following gives everey occurences of the the vendor ID.

```
SELECT vend_id
FROM Products;
```
Using the `DISTINCT` keyword instructs the database to only return distinct values. The `DISTINCT` keyword must be placed directly in front of the column names.  

```
SELECT DISTINCT vend_id
FROM Products;
```
{{% alert note %}}
Can't Be Partially `DISTINCT`
{{% /alert %}}

The `DISTINCT` keyword applies to all columns, not just the one it precedes. The following returns all rows retrieved because the combination of the specified columns are not distinct.  
```
SELECT DISTINCT vend_id, prod_price
FROM Products;
```

# Limiting Results

To select top number of entries, use the `TOP` keyword. The following uses the `SELECT TOP 5 statement` to retrieve just the first five rows. Please note that this applies to Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server but not to other DBMs.  

```
SELECT TOP 5 prod_name
FROM Products;
```

# Using Comments

Commenting in not allowed in Access at this point of time. The following is applicable to other DBMs.  
A # at the start of a line makes the entire line a comment.  

```
# This is a comment
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;
```
Using `/*  */` for multi-lines comments.  

```
/* SELECT prod_name, vend_id
FROM Products; */
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;
```
Anything between `/* and */` is comment text. This type of comment is often used to comment out code, as seen in this example.
