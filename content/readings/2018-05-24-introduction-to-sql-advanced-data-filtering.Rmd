# Combining `WHERE` Clauses

We can specify multiple `WHERE` clauses. These clauses may be used in two ways: as `AND` clauses or as `OR` clauses.  

<br> 

## Using the `AND` Operator

This is used to filter by more than one column.  

```
SELECT prod_id, prod_price, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01' AND prod_price <= 4;
```
`AND` instructs the database management system software to return only rows that meet all the conditions specified. If a product is made by vendor DLL01, but it costs more than $4, it is not retrieved. Additional filter conditions could be used as well, each separated by an `AND` keyword.  

<br> 

## Using the `OR` Operator

The `OR` operator instructs the database management system software to retrieve rows that match either condition. It is the opposite to `AND`. For example:  

```
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01' OR vend_id = 'BRS01';
```
The above SQL statement retrieves the product name and price for any products made by either of the two specified vendors.  

<br>

## Understanding Order of Evaluation

Let's list of all products costing $10 or more made by vendors *DLL01* and *BRS01*.  

```
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01' OR vend_id = 'BRS01'
AND prod_price >= 10;
```
The output is shown below:

One can observe that four of the rows returned have prices less than $10. Why is that so?  
This is caused by the orede of evaluation. SQL (like most languages) processes `AND` operators before OR operators. Thus, it was read as *any products costing $10 or more made by vendor BRS01, and any products made by vendor DLL01 regardless of price.*  
The solution is to add in parentheses to explicitly group related operators because parentheses have a higher order of evaluation.  

```
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE (vend_id = 'DLL01' OR vend_id = 'BRS01')
AND prod_price >= 10;
```

# Using the `IN` Operator 

`IN` is a keyword used in a `WHERE` clause to specify a list of values to be matched using an `OR` comparison. However, it has several advantages:  

- Cleaner and easier to read syntax.
- The order of evaluation is easier to manage when `IN` is used in conjunction with other `AND` and `OR` operators.
- Execute faster.
- The `IN` operator can contain another `SELECT` statement (known as subqueries).  

```
SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id IN ('DLL01','BRS01')
ORDER BY prod_name;
```

<br>

# Using the NOT Operator  

`NOT` is a keyword used in a `WHERE` clause to negate a condition. It can be used before the column to filter on, not just after it.  

```
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE NOT vend_id = 'DLL01'
ORDER BY prod_name;
```

The same thing can be accomplished by using `< >`.  

```
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE vend_id <> 'DLL01'
ORDER BY prod_name;
```
`NOT` is useful in more complex clauses. For example, using `NOT` in conjunction with an `IN` operator makes it simple to find all rows that do not match a list of criteria.
