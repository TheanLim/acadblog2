# Biography

I am a statistician and a psychologist from the University of Minnesota. I am currently analyzing datasets from the Work and Organization lab of UMN to study the effect of leadership behaviours on the team creativity and effectiveness. I am also interested in learning and building side-projects using Statistical Modellings and Machine Learnings.
