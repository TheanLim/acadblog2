This is the Hello World blog post using Rmd...

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

Let's try some math:

$$\beta = \alpha$$

How about inline math such as $b + \alpha$

How about some R code?

```{r, fig.cap= "This is a simple plot"}
plot(1:10, 41:50, col = "blue")
```

Let's try mentioning r function.  

`plot()`

How about using the alert note?

{{% alert note %}}
This is an alert. R function within the alert: `sum()`
{{% /alert %}}

Let's try alert warning:


{{% alert warning %}}
Do *not* get serious with `arrange()`
{{% /alert %}}

# New Header 1
Just pure chunk of code (not evaluating)

```
blogdown::install_hugo()
# or
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
```
