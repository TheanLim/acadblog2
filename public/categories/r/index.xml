For example, one can group their customers into several clusters so that one can aim a specific way of marketing to each type of customers.
Since there is no preexisting group labels for each cluster, we can never know the accuracy of clustering methods unless using a simulated data.</description>

The conditional probability equals to the fraction of the \(K\) training data points that belongs to class \(j\).</description>
