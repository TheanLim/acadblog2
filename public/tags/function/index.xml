      <description>IntroductionSelf-defined KNN ClassifierSimulation, errors and KNN BoundarySimulate dataTraining and Testing ErrorsDecision boundariesNext stepsIntroductionThe K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier works by indentifying \(K\) (a positive integer) training data points that are closest (defined by Euclidean distance) to a test observation \(x_0\) and calculate the conditional probability of \(x_0\) belongs to class \(j\). The conditional probability equals to the fraction of the \(K\) training data points that belongs to class \(j\).</description>
